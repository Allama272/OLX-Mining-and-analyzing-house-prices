# OLX-Mining-and-analyzing-house-prices

## The main Aim of this project is to collect apartment sale ads information from OLX Alexandria -for now- and analyze it



## The Scrapper automatically collects data every 15 days and commits them 

## The collected data consists of [price, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, area, location, date posted and id]

#### The id is the unique id olx gives to each ad in order to keep track of any redundant data in the future


### I am also hoping to begin collecting data from other sources in the future and building a massive data frame of almost all apartments in Alexandria and then hopefully Egypt
